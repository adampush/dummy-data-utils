dummy data utils
================

This repository is for function-ized code snippets of helpful utilities
for creating dummy data objects (e.g. list of dictionaries) for testing
concepts and things like that.

It is very small as of 2017 jan 18 wed because I just started it.

It will probably change drastically and at an unpredictable rate (slow, fast,
ludicrous speed).
